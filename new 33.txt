The Role of AI in Language - Breaking open the language barrier will blow the potential of AI wide open.
This is huge for global commerce, and society in general. Without language barriers, imagine how much more productive we could be, or how many people we could learn from or talk to that we previously couldn’t, or how much more successful global businesses could be — especially smaller companies that can’t afford a large staff of translators.

Without language barriers, the world opens up, especially to those who don’t have the privileges of people in first-world countries.

There’s a long way to go before computers can understand language. Every language is complex, with subtleties, dialects, slang, implications, emotion, tone, narrative and context, all of which are hard for machines to understand. While software like TensorFlow and CNDK are a massive step forward, we need human interaction to get there.

And we will get there, but it will take at least 15 years. Samantha from Her, HAL from 2001, C-3PO from Star Wars — and all the other artificial intelligence we’ve been promised — are inevitable. It doesn’t need to be presented physically, as an android or robot. But it has to think like a human. Breaking open the language barrier will blow the potential of AI wide open. Until then, AI and humans working together is the best way to reap the benefits of existing technology. We don’t have to wait. We can use AI to change the world right now.
